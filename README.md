# zoltar.js

A fortune-telling script that outputs a fortune comprised of 3 random phrases to the console. 

**This script was written as a Codecademy Javascript project.**

The fortune contains 3 randomly generated elements, each taken from different arrays of possible messages.

The format of the fortune is as follows:

` I am The Great Zoltar! Prepare for your fortune!`
` I see [random phrase A]...` 
` I am receiving [random phrase B]...`
` You must [random phrase C]!`
` Zoltar has spoken!`

For example:

` I am the Great Zoltar! Prepare for your fortune!`
` I see a woman...`
` I am receiving a scent... of cigarettes...`
` You must beware! Do not be deceived!`
` Zoltar has spoken!`

# Codecademy Project Requirements

You will build a message generator program. 

Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 

Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 

To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

## Project Objectives:

- [x] Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- [x] Use Git version control
- [x] Use command line
- [x] Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
